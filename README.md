In the provided Java code for the chatting application, the following technologies and libraries are utilized:

1.Java Swing: The javax.swing package is extensively used to create graphical user interface (GUI) components such as JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JTextField, and JButton for building the user interface of the application.

2.AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): AWT components and classes are used indirectly, as Swing is built on top of AWT, providing more advanced and flexible GUI components.

3.Socket Programming: The application employs Java's socket programming capabilities to establish communication between the server and clients. The ServerSocket and Socket classes are utilized to handle incoming connections and data streams.

4.Multithreading: Multithreading is employed to manage concurrent tasks, such as handling multiple client connections simultaneously. Threads are created to manage incoming client connections and messages asynchronously.

5.ile I/O: The application uses DataInputStream and DataOutputStream for reading and writing data streams to handle communication between the server and clients.

6.Image Handling: Images are loaded and displayed using ImageIcon and Image classes for various components such as icons and profile pictures.

7.Event Handling: Event listeners (ActionListener, MouseListener) are implemented to handle user interactions with GUI components, such as mouse clicks and button presses.

8.Layout Management: The LayoutManager interface and layout manager classes (null layout, BorderLayout, BoxLayout) are utilized to arrange and position GUI components within the frame.
